== Order

This chapter describes how to handle new orders.

=== Do the request

The first step which is required to create a new order is to send a `POST` to `{order-url}` with the following fields:

[cols="a,a,a,a"]
|===
|Name|Description|Type|Required
|`addressesEqual`|`true` if billing and delivery addresses are the equal|`bool`|{chck}
|`bcity`|Billing city|`string` 1.5+|{nch} only needed if billing address is different from delivery address
|`bpostCode`|Billing post code|`string`
|`bstate`|Billing state|`string`
|`bstreet`|Billing street|`string`
|`bstreetNumber`|Billing street number|`string`
|`city`|Delivery city|`string`|{chck}
|`postCode`|Delivery post code|`string`|{chck}
|`state`|Delivery state|`string`|{chck}
|`street`|Delivery street|`string`|{chck}
|`streetNumber`|Delivery street number|`string`|{chck}
|`company`|Company/Music Society/Band|`string`|{nch}
|`email`|Email of the issuer|`string`|{chck}
|`firstName`|First name of the issuer|`string`|{chck}
|`lastName`|Last name of the issuer|`string`|{chck}
|`salutation`|Salutation of the issuer|`string`|{chck}
|`telephone`|Phone number of the issuer|`string`|{nch}
|===

If the request was successful, certain things will happen:

. The order will be persisted into the database.
. An email will be send to the issuer with further details (and the bill?).
. The owner receives an email in order to prepare the delivery.

NOTE: The response will be a single instance of a bill, for further details see <<bill>>.
